# Clicky Game

The Clicky Game is a Super Smash Bros themed memory game. The user needs to remember which of the 12 characters they have clicked on to gain a point. After each click all characters will be randomized to be displayed in a new order. If the character has already been clicked on, the game is over and the score will go back to zero. <br>
